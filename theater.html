    <h3>THE ANNIVERSARY : a play by Anton Chekov</h3>
    <p>
        <b>KHIRIN.</b><br>
        [Standing up] I have the honour to congratulate you, Andrey
        Andreyevitch, on the fiftieth anniversary of our Bank, and hope that...<br>
        
        <b>SHIPUCHIN.</b><br>
        [Warmly shakes hands] Thank you, my dear sir! Thank you!
        I think that in view of the unique character of the day, as it is an
        anniversary, we may kiss each other!... [They kiss] I am very, very
        glad! Thank you for your service... for everything! If, in the course of
        the time during which I have had the honour to be Chairman of this Bank
        anything useful has been done, the credit is due, more than to anybody
        else, to my colleagues. [Sighs] Yes, fifteen years! Fifteen years as my
        name's Shipuchin! [Changes his tone] Where's my report? Is it getting on?<br>
        
        <b>KHIRIN.</b><br> 
        Yes; there's only five pages left.<br>
        
        <b>SHIPUCHIN.</b><br> 
        Excellent. Then it will be ready by three?<br>
        
        <b>KHIRIN.</b><br>
        If nothing occurs to disturb me, I'll get it done. Nothing of
        any importance is now left.<br>
        
        <b>SHIPUCHIN.</b><br>
        Splendid. Splendid, as my name's Shipuchin! The general
        meeting will be at four. If you please, my dear fellow. Give me the
        first half, I'll peruse it.... Quick.... [Takes the report] I base
        enormous hopes on this report. It's my _profession de foi_, or, better
        still, my firework. [Note: The actual word employed.] My firework, as my
        name's Shipuchin! [Sits and reads the report to himself] I'm hellishly
        tired.... My gout kept on giving me trouble last night, all the morning
        I was running about, and then these excitements, ovations, agitations...
        I'm tired!<br>
        
        <b>KHIRIN.<br>
        </b> Two... nought... nought... three... nine... two... nought. I
        can't see straight after all these figures.... Three... one... six...
        four... one... five.... [Uses the counting-frame.]<br>
